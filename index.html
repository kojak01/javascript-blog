                <p>Images may be two-dimensional, such as a photograph, screen display, and as well as a three-dimensional, such as a statue or hologram.</p>
                <h2 id="volatile">Volatile image</h2>
                <p>Is one that exists only for a short period of time. This may be a reflection of an object by a mirror, a projection of a camera obscura, or a scene displayed on a cathode ray tube.</p>
                <h2 id="mental">Mental image</h2>
                <p>Exists in an individual's mind, as something one remembers or imagines. The subject of an image need not be real; it may be an abstract concept, such as a graph, function, or "imaginary" entity.</p>
                <h2 id="still">Still image</h2>
                <p>A typical font may contain hundreds or even thousands of glyphs, often representing characters from many different languages.</p>
