                    <h1>Cat Bob</h1>
                    <p>Bob is a stunning cat, especially considering that when she came into our lives she only weighed five pounds and had lost much of her fur. She is rather meticulous about her appearance as well and continually grooms herself, keeping her fur luxe and her toe-tufts reasonably white. She also looks smashing in a floppy bowtie. Since she has become an outdoor cat she has gotten some sun highlights in her black fur, but this does not detract from her beauty.</p>

                    <h1>Dog Rocky</h1>
                    <p>Spending just 15-30 minutes with your dog can help you feel more calm and relaxed, reducing stress and increasing happiness. Playing with your pup increases your brain’s levels of dopamine and serotonin, both of which are neurotransmitters associated with pleasure and tranquility. So the next time you’re feeling down, grab the newest toy from your BarkBox and spend some time with your pup! That wagging tail will be sure to put a smile on your face.</p>

                    <h1>Hamster Fred</h1>
                    <p>Hamsters are great pets except when they get out of their cage. I have a four year old cat and she leaves the hamsters alone. She likes to smell them when they get out. My momma has given birth twice. She had fourteen babies in two litters. Most were adopted out and five were eaten by the mother! One of them fell off of the sundeck! I have two exercise balls with loose lids. This is the main way that they escape! I love my hamsters! They make cool pets. Quiet and good natured! Time to buy better exercise balls!</p>
